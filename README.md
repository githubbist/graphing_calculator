Tkinter Graphing Calculator

This calculator is/was designed to facilitate graphing equations and solving functions.  I've owned a Ti Nspire, Ti-84, and a Ti-89.  They have all broken.  Perhaps I'm too hard on my calculators, thus this was born.

This first version of the calculator receives 3 inputs:
The Function to be plotted.
The Domain.
Steps.

The function and domain entrys are evaluated as expressions using the eval method.  The user must use python syntax for both the function and domain.  The user can implement the math library from python.  The domain syntax is as follow: [start, stop].  The step is your resolution.

My hope is that this calculator evolves to handle differential equations and plot vector fields, along with much more!
